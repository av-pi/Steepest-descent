# Steepest Descent Algorithm in MATLAB

## Overview

This MATLAB code implements the steepest descent algorithm for finding the minimum or maximum of a single-variable or multivariable function. The algorithm incorporates Newton's line search to enhance convergence and precision. Steepest descent is an iterative optimization method commonly used in mathematical optimization and machine learning.

## Features

- **Steepest Descent:** Utilizes the steepest descent method for iterative optimization.
  
- **Newton's Line Search:** Implements Newton's line search as part of the optimization process.

## Usage

1. Open the MATLAB environment.

2. Load or copy the provided MATLAB script containing the steepest descent algorithm.

3. Define the target function within the script. Modify the objective function based on your optimization problem.

4. Set initial guess values, tolerance, and other parameters as needed.

5. Run the script to execute the steepest descent algorithm.

## Example

```matlab
% Define the target function
function f = myObjective(x)
    % Your objective function here
    f = x^2 - 4*x + 4;
end

% Set initial guess and tolerance
x0 = 0;
tolerance = 1e-6;

% Run steepest descent algorithm
result = steepestDescent(@myObjective, x0, tolerance);
disp('Optimal solution:');
disp(result);
